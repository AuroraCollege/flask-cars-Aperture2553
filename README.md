# Flask - Cars ðŸš—

This is a simple flask app displaying a little bit of info from a database (borrowed from [https://github.com/dtaivpp/car_company_database](https://github.com/dtaivpp/car_company_database)). 

Your task is to make it look better! Use CSS, perhaps Bootstrap, and consider looking at other tables in the database too (there's lots there!).
